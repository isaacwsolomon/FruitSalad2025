If the user clicks 'Create Game' they will be brought to a page with an input box allowing the user to specify how many cards 
each player is allowed to write. In the header will be a number to share to the rest of the players so they can join the 
game.The user now enters their words/sentence to the cards and clicks confirm when finished. The user is then brought to a 
page displaying everyone who has joined. As the user is the one who created the game, they are considered the leader. The
leader can select the number of teams and manually assign players to each team, or opt for random teams. Once 
everyone is assigned to a team, the leader can press 'Start'

Before each round the leader decides for 30, 40, 50, or 60 seconds. From now on the 
other player's phones are no longer needed. The leaders phone will display whos go it is and from what team. The phone should
be passed to this person.
The first round is the describe round. The player then presses 'Begin' and a timer at the top of the page will begin counting down. 
The player will be presented with one of the cards that had been written earlier. The rules of this round is to describe the card without saying 
any of the words on the card. If the team gets it right the player describing selects the green box and if they are unable to guess it, the user presses 
the yellow box. There is unlimited skips. Once the time has gone the page will display how many you got right and the leader board. At this point
the player will be able to edit their score incase of any mistakes. It then moves onto the next player. Once all of the cards
have been guessed the game moves to the next round. If this happens in the middle of someones go, the remainder of the time 
will be added to that teams next turn.

The next round is acting out. Again the leader decides on the time. In this round players can only act with their body and 
are not allowed to use any words. The interface for this round is the exact same as the previous. 

The third round is one word. The players are only able to say one word to describe what it says on the card 

The final round is the noise round. The player reading the card must go out of site from the rest of the team to disable the
chance of cheating. They must then try to describe the card with only noises, no words or acting.

Once all rounds are played the leader board is displayed and the winner is announced. In the leader board, stats will be displayed showing how many guessed
right, how many skipps etc

In between rounds, the leader will have the option to pass on leadership. This will allow the game to be played on a different
players phone in case the leaders phone is running low on battery / needs to take a call etc. 
At any time during the game, the user can press 'End Game' in the top right of the screen to finish the game early. The leaderboard will then be displayed 
and a winner announced
